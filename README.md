# IMDb Top 250 Movies Web Scraping and Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involves web scraping data of the top 250 movies listed on IMDb and performing insightful analysis using Python. The primary objective was to extract relevant movie data and derive meaningful insights using data analysis techniques.

## Features
- **Web Scraping**: Extracted key details such as movie titles, rankings, release years, ratings, and more from IMDb's Top 250 movies list using Python libraries.
- **Data Analysis**: Analyzed the scraped data to identify trends such as the highest-rated movies, the most frequent genres, and average ratings over decades.
- **Visualization**: Created visualizations to present insights effectively, including bar charts, histograms, and pie charts.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - Web Scraping: `BeautifulSoup`, `requests`
  - Data Analysis: `pandas`, `numpy`
  - Visualization: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

## Key Insights
- Distribution of ratings and genres among top movies.
- Analysis of movie trends over the decades.
- Identification of top-performing directors and actors.

## How It Works
1. **Scraping**: Used `BeautifulSoup` to parse HTML and extract data from IMDb's Top 250 movies page.
2. **Cleaning**: Processed and cleaned the scraped data for analysis.
3. **Analysis**: Performed statistical analysis to uncover trends.
4. **Visualization**: Generated visual representations of the data to communicate findings effectively.

## Challenges
- Handling dynamic content and ensuring the scraping process adhered to ethical guidelines.
- Cleaning and preprocessing the data for accurate analysis.

## Outcomes
This project enhanced my skills in web scraping, data wrangling, and data visualization. It also provided a deeper understanding of how to work with real-world datasets and extract actionable insights.
